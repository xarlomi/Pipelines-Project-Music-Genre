HOW DANCEABLE AND ENERGETICAL IS A MUSIC GENRE?

    At a party, in the gym or just dancing on your own in your kitchen we sometimes need (really need) energetical, highly rythmical, loud music to which lose our sense of reallity and dance uncontrollably. In a world in which radio, ads, tv are dominated by the mainstream genres (in my case reggaeton) these necessarily become repetitive and boring. Now here you will find a starter pack to finally substitute your daily ASAP-Drake-Lamar   

    For this reason, my aim with my first data base analysis is to  provide a list of genres carachterised by their power to make you loose your feet, and compare them with each other. 
    The dataset is named genres_v2.csv which I downloaded using the Kaggle API. The owner of that dataset used the Spotify API and their parameters to rank levels of danceability and energy of a genre. 

    The choice of my second data base came from my curiosity to discover in depth the genres analysed in the previous one. More particularly, to analyse the nationality of all these genres and their diversifications and mutations since then. I obtained  the data by scrapping from the website http://everynoise.com/countries.html

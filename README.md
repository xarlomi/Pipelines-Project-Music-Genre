 ## HOW DANCEABLE AND ENERGETICAL IS A MUSIC GENRE?
'''
    At a party, in the gym or just dancing on your own in your kitchen we sometimes need (really need) energetical, highly rythmical, loud music to which lose our sense of reality and dance uncontrollably. In a world in which radio, ads, tv are dominated by the mainstream genres (in my case reggaeton) these necessarily become repetitive and boring. Specially now more than ever, here is a starter pack to finally substitute your daily ASAP-Drake-Lamar; and to make you shake even during a lonely lockdown.

    For this reason, my aim with my first data base analysis is to analyse the energy and danceability of 10 different music genres. The dataset is named genres_v2.csv which I downloaded using the Kaggle API. The owner of that dataset used the Spotify API and their parameters to rank levels of danceability and energy of a genre. Here I use this parameters to analyse the apparent negative relation between energy and danceability, which I found that this relation changes considerably in function of the genre. That is, although this negative relatioin exists (-0.36) in Trance music(e.g), in hiphop is almost non-existent. I end this analysis by looking for the most danceable & energetic genres of all (techno and tech house).

    Once I got the most energetic & danceable genres, I decided then to provide a list with the varieties and mutations it exists of these genres in Western Europe; so to obtain greater stock of two genres that I previously thought to be narrower. I obtained this data by scrapping from the website http://everynoise.com/countries.html.
